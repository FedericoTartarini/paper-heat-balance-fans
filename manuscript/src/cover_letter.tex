\opening{Dear Dr. P. Dempsey,}

\makelettertitle

We submit an original research article entitled ``Application of Gagge's energy balance model to determine humidity-dependent temperature thresholds for healthy adults using electric fans during heatwaves'' for consideration to be published in Applied Ergonomics.
The authors are Federico Tartarini, Stefano Schiavon, Ollie Jay, Edward Arens, and Charlie Huizenga.
We are experts in thermal comfort, heat stress, and thermal physiology.
We confirm that this manuscript it is not currently under consideration for publication in any other journal.

Several current health guidelines worldwide underestimate the benefit that air movement has in cooling people and discourage them from using fans when air temperatures exceed 35~$^{\circ}$C.
This significantly reduces the applicability of this affordable, sustainable and effective cooling strategy during heatwaves.
We used a validated energy balance model, developed by Gagge et al. (1971), to determine how environmental (air speed and mean radiant temperature) and personal (metabolic rate, clothing) conditions affect humidity-dependent temperature thresholds at which fans can be used.

We compare our results with those obtained by laboratory-based physiological studies and other biophysical models developed by Jay et al. (2015), Morris et al. (2021), and the Predicted Heat Strain (PHS) model present in the ISO 7933 standard. Moreover, to better understand in which locations and how many people worldwide would benefit from using electric fans, we compare our results with climate and population data from ASHRAE and the United Nations population database.

Electric fans are a cheaper and far more energy-efficient alternative to compressor-based air conditioning and we conclude that:
\begin{enumerate}[itemindent=.5cm,nolistsep]
    \item Health guidelines regarding electric fan use during heatwaves currently underestimate the benefit of air movement.
    \item Electric fans can be used safely even when the indoor dry-bulb temperature exceeds the skin temperature, across a wide range of relative humidity.
    \item Over the last 20 years, even during the most extreme weather events, the use of fans would have been beneficial in 103 of the 115 most populous cities worldwide.
\end{enumerate}

To help people worldwide to determine under which environmental and personal conditions the use of fans is beneficial, we include the model used in the manuscript embodied in two free and open-source tools.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of any further assistance. Thank you in advance for considering our research for publication in Applied Ergonomics.
