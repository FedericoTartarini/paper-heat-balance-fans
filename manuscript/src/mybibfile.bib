abstract = {Temperature and sensory indices of human responsee to the thermal environment are often expressed in terms of the known in a controlled laboratory environment, as a standard. The three rational indices of this type to be considered are (1) ASHARE's Standard Effective Temperature (SET*) Index, defined as the equivalent dry bulb temperature of an isothermal environment at 50{\%} RH in wich a subject, while wearing clothing standardized for activity concerned, would have the same heat stress (skin temperature Tsk) and thermoregulatory strain (skin wettedness, w) as in the actual test environment; (2) Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) Index, defined in terms of the heat load that would be required to restore a state of "Comfort" and evaluated by his Comfort Equation; and (3) Winslow's Skin Wettedness Index of "Thermal Discomfort" (DISC) defined in terms of the fraction of the body surface, wet with perspiration, required to regulate body temperature by evaporative cooling. The classic difference between PMV and DISC as predictors of warm discomfort occurs at very high and very low humidity but both lead to essentially the same judgment at average humidities (40-60{\%} RH or 1-2 kPa). A new index PMV* is proposed for any dry or humid environment by simply replacing operative temperature To in Fanger's Comfort Equation with SET*. The use of PMV* as a sensor of heat stress and strain, is illustrated for typical HVAC situations and with a new Comfort-Humidity psychometric chart for indoor environments.},

abstract = {Heat waves continue to claim lives, with the elderly and poor at greatest risk. A simple and cost-effective intervention is an electric fan, but public health agencies warn against their use despite no evidence refuting their efficacy in heat waves. A conceptual human heat balance model can be used to estimate the evaporative requirement for heat balance, the potential for evaporative heat loss from the skin, and the predicted sweat rate, with and without an electrical fan during heat wave conditions. Using criteria defined by the literature, it is clear that fans increase the predicted critical environmental limits for both the physiological compensation of endogenous/exogenous heat, and the onset of cardiovascular strain by an air temperature of {\~{}}3-4째C, irrespective of relative humidity (RH) for the young and elderly. Even above these critical limits, fans would apparently still provide marginal benefits at air temperatures as high as 51.1째C at 10{\%}RH for young adults and 48.1째C at 10{\%}RH for the elderly. Previous concerns that dehydration would be exacerbated with fan use do not seem likely, except under very hot ({\textgreater}40째C) and dry ({\textless}10{\%}RH) conditions, when predicted sweat losses are only greater with fans by a minor amount ({\~{}}20-30mL/h). Relative to the peak outdoor environmental conditions reported during ten of the most severe heat waves in recent history, fan use would be advisable in all of these situations, even when reducing the predicted maximum sweat output for the elderly. The protective benefit of fans appears to be underestimated by current guidelines.},
