abstract = {Temperature and sensory indices of human responsee to the thermal environment are often expressed in terms of the known in a controlled laboratory environment, as a standard. The three rational indices of this type to be considered are (1) ASHARE's Standard Effective Temperature (SET*) Index, defined as the equivalent dry bulb temperature of an isothermal environment at 50{\%} RH in wich a subject, while wearing clothing standardized for activity concerned, would have the same heat stress (skin temperature Tsk) and thermoregulatory strain (skin wettedness, w) as in the actual test environment; (2) Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) Index, defined in terms of the heat load that would be required to restore a state of "Comfort" and evaluated by his Comfort Equation; and (3) Winslow's Skin Wettedness Index of "Thermal Discomfort" (DISC) defined in terms of the fraction of the body surface, wet with perspiration, required to regulate body temperature by evaporative cooling. The classic difference between PMV and DISC as predictors of warm discomfort occurs at very high and very low humidity but both lead to essentially the same judgment at average humidities (40-60{\%} RH or 1-2 kPa). A new index PMV* is proposed for any dry or humid environment by simply replacing operative temperature To in Fanger's Comfort Equation with SET*. The use of PMV* as a sensor of heat stress and strain, is illustrated for typical HVAC situations and with a new Comfort-Humidity psychometric chart for indoor environments.},

abstract = {Heat waves continue to claim lives, with the elderly and poor at greatest risk. A simple and cost-effective intervention is an electric fan, but public health agencies warn against their use despite no evidence refuting their efficacy in heat waves. A conceptual human heat balance model can be used to estimate the evaporative requirement for heat balance, the potential for evaporative heat loss from the skin, and the predicted sweat rate, with and without an electrical fan during heat wave conditions. Using criteria defined by the literature, it is clear that fans increase the predicted critical environmental limits for both the physiological compensation of endogenous/exogenous heat, and the onset of cardiovascular strain by an air temperature of {\~{}}3-4°C, irrespective of relative humidity (RH) for the young and elderly. Even above these critical limits, fans would apparently still provide marginal benefits at air temperatures as high as 51.1°C at 10{\%}RH for young adults and 48.1°C at 10{\%}RH for the elderly. Previous concerns that dehydration would be exacerbated with fan use do not seem likely, except under very hot ({\textgreater}40°C) and dry ({\textless}10{\%}RH) conditions, when predicted sweat losses are only greater with fans by a minor amount ({\~{}}20-30mL/h). Relative to the peak outdoor environmental conditions reported during ten of the most severe heat waves in recent history, fan use would be advisable in all of these situations, even when reducing the predicted maximum sweat output for the elderly. The protective benefit of fans appears to be underestimated by current guidelines.},

abstract = {Heat or hot weather that lasts for several days, often referred to as “a heatwave” can have a significant impact on society, including a rise in mortality and morbidity. Heatwaves also place an increased strain on infrastructure (power, water and transport). Clothes and food retailing, tourism and ecosystem services can also be affected, such that there may be socioeconomic “winners and losers” from heatwave events. In some instances, heatwaves may even trigger social disturbances at a number of levels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe impacts of heatwaves can be great and sometimes catastrophic, as manifested by the large number of heat-related deaths recorded across Europe in July and August 2003, and the Russian Federation in July and August 2010. While the effects of heat may be exacerbated in cities, due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, the livelihoods and social well- being of non-urban communities can also be severely disrupted during and after periods of unusually hot weather.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThis Guidance has been developed jointly by WMO and WHO to outline for practitioners in both NMHSs and National Health Services (NHSs) the issues surrounding the general heat–health problem and present how an understanding of the biometeorology, epidemiology, public-health and risk-communication aspects of heat as a hazard can be used to inform the development of an HHWS as part of a wider HHAP. The Guidance places emphasis on the practical aspects of HHWSs at a generic level and is not intended to be prescriptive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe Guidance has been produced to have global applicability.

@article{Jay2019a,
abstract = {We assessed whether increasing airflow with an electric fan is similarly effective as decreasing air temperature with air cooling (AC) in preventing heat-related reductions in productivity, and elevations in body temperatures and discomfort in a warm/humid indoor environment. In 48 experimental trials, we compared the reduction in the human heat stress response of sixteen participants during 135 min of intermittent arm ergometry at a fixed heart rate of 110 beats min −1 , from a simulated tropical environment (HOT; 30 °C, 70{\%}RH; wind {\textless} 0.2 m s −1 ) to that observed with either a, (i) 7 °C reduction in air temperature (AC; 23 °C, 70{\%}RH, wind {\textless} 0.2 m s −1 ); or (ii) facilitated airflow (FAN; 30 °C, 70{\%}RH, wind = 4.2 m s −1 ). Cumulative work was similarly improved (+11{\%}) by FAN compared to AC. Likewise, reductions in rectal temperature, thermal sensation, and thermal discomfort were similar with the two different cooling strategies. Sweat losses in the FAN trial were higher compared to AC but lower than HOT without fanning. In conclusion, fanning offers an effective method for alleviating thermal stress and preventing productivity losses for workers exposed to environmental heat. Moving air instead of chilling it may require a little more sweating, but it can save electricity and hence lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to AC.},

@article{Lipczynska2018a,
abstract = {Here we present a field study examining the impact of elevated room temperature and air movement on thermal comfort and self-reported productivity. This experiment was performed in three environmental conditions (one with a set-point of 23 °C—a typical set-point used in Singapore—and two elevated (up to 28 °C) room temperature conditions). Occupants had shared control of ceiling fans. The results show that the most comfortable thermal condition, with thermal sensation closest to neutral, is achieved at a room temperature of 26 °C with operating fans. Increasing the temperature set-point from 23 °C to 26 °C resulted in a significant increase in thermal acceptability (from 59{\%} to 91{\%}), and a 44 kWh/m2yr savings in electrical energy used for comfort cooling. We found that a room's set-point temperature can be increased up to 27 °C without creating a negative impact when controllable air movement is provided compared to an environment with a set-point of 23 °C. Thermal satisfaction is significantly higher in spaces of 26 °C with operating fans, than when the room's temperature is set at the typical 23 °C. Moreover, the relative humidity in the office is decreased from 62{\%} (when the temperature was 23 °C) to 50{\%} when the temperature was 27 °C. Occupant's self-reported ability to concentrate, be alert, and ability to be productive was comparably high in all conditions. The results indicate that work performance is poorly correlated with room temperature, but increases with greater individual thermal satisfaction.},

@article{Yang2015a,
abstract = {In warm environments, isothermal cooling by deliberately enhanced air movement can maintain thermal comfort using less energy than compressor-based air conditioning. To evaluate the performance of a brushless direct current (DC) stand fan, the cooling fan efficiency (CFE) index was measured in a climatic chamber under four dry-bulb temperatures (24, 26, 28, and 30°C), six speed settings (corresponding to centreline speeds in the range 0.6-2.5m/s at 1m distance), two fan-manikin distances (1 and 2m) and two orientations (front, side). The CFE index is defined as the ratio of the whole-body cooling effect generated by non-uniform airflow from the fan to its power consumption (°C/W). The CFE index overcomes the limitations of assessing the cooling effect based just on a few air speed measurements. The results show that the CFE index is influenced by dry-bulb temperature, fan speed setting, and fan-manikin distance, but not by fan-manikin orientation. The lower the temperature and the closer the fan, the higher is the CFE index. Increasing fan speed setting simultaneously enhances whole-body cooling and increases power use. Consequently, the CFE has a non-monotonic relationship with fan speed setting and the peak value is reached for an intermediate speed. As compared with previous testing results using an alternating current stand fan, the CFE index of the DC fan we tested is three times higher. As a complement to air-conditioning, the tested stand fan is a suitable energy-efficient technology for providing thermal comfort in warm environments.},

@article{Raftery2019,
abstract = {We measured indoor air speeds generated by ceiling fans in 78 full-scale laboratory tests. The factors were the room size, fan diameter, type, speed, direction (up or down), blade height, and mount distance (i.e. blade to ceiling height). We demonstrated the influence of these factors, showing that the most significant are speed, diameter and direction. With other factors fixed, the average room air speed in the occupied zone increases proportionally with fan air speed and diameter. Blowing fans upwards yields lower but far more uniform air speeds than downwards. We show that for the same fan diameter and airflow, fan type has little effect on the air speed distribution in the region outside the fan blades. We developed several new dimensionless representations and demonstrate that they are appropriate for comparisons over a wide range of fan and room characteristics. Dimensionless linear models predict the lowest, average, and highest air speeds in a room with a median (and 90 th percentile) absolute error of 0.03 (0.08), 0.05 (0.13), and 0.12 (0.26) m/s respectively over all 56 downwards tests, representing common applications. These models allow designers to quickly and easily estimate the air speeds they can expect for a given fan and room. We include all measured data and analysis code in this paper.},
