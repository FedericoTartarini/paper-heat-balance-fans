abstract = {Despite their adverse impacts, definitions and measurements of heat waves are ambiguous and inconsistent, generally being endemic to only the group affected, or the respective study reporting the analysis. The present study addresses this issue by employing a set of three heat wave definitions, derived from surveying heat-related indices in the climate science literature. The definitions include three or more consecutive days above one of the following: the 90th percentile for maximum temperature, the 90th percentile for minimum temperature, and positive extreme heat factor (EHF) conditions. Additionally, each index is studied using a multiaspect framework measuring heat wave number, duration, participating days, and the peak and mean magnitudes. Observed climatologies and trends computed by Sen's Kendall slope estimator are presented for the Australian continent for two time periods (1951–2008 and 1971–2008). Trends in all aspects and definitions are smaller in magnitude but more significant for 1951–2008 than for 1971–2008. Considerable similarities exist in trends of the yearly number of days participating in a heat wave and yearly heat wave frequency, suggesting that the number of available heat wave days drives the number of events. Larger trends in the hottest part of a heat wave suggest that heat wave intensity is increasing faster than the mean magnitude. Although the direct results of this study cannot be inferred for other regions, the methodology has been designed as such that it is widely applicable. Furthermore, it includes a range of definitions that may be useful for a wide range of systems impacted by heat waves.},

@article{Gagge1986,
abstract = {Temperature and sensory indices of human responsee to the thermal environment are often expressed in terms of the known in a controlled laboratory environment, as a standard. The three rational indices of this type to be considered are (1) ASHARE's Standard Effective Temperature (SET*) Index, defined as the equivalent dry bulb temperature of an isothermal environment at 50{\%} RH in wich a subject, while wearing clothing standardized for activity concerned, would have the same heat stress (skin temperature Tsk) and thermoregulatory strain (skin wettedness, w) as in the actual test environment; (2) Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) Index, defined in terms of the heat load that would be required to restore a state of "Comfort" and evaluated by his Comfort Equation; and (3) Winslow's Skin Wettedness Index of "Thermal Discomfort" (DISC) defined in terms of the fraction of the body surface, wet with perspiration, required to regulate body temperature by evaporative cooling. The classic difference between PMV and DISC as predictors of warm discomfort occurs at very high and very low humidity but both lead to essentially the same judgment at average humidities (40-60{\%} RH or 1-2 kPa). A new index PMV* is proposed for any dry or humid environment by simply replacing operative temperature To in Fanger's Comfort Equation with SET*. The use of PMV* as a sensor of heat stress and strain, is illustrated for typical HVAC situations and with a new Comfort-Humidity psychometric chart for indoor environments.},

abstract = {Heat waves continue to claim lives, with the elderly and poor at greatest risk. A simple and cost-effective intervention is an electric fan, but public health agencies warn against their use despite no evidence refuting their efficacy in heat waves. A conceptual human heat balance model can be used to estimate the evaporative requirement for heat balance, the potential for evaporative heat loss from the skin, and the predicted sweat rate, with and without an electrical fan during heat wave conditions. Using criteria defined by the literature, it is clear that fans increase the predicted critical environmental limits for both the physiological compensation of endogenous/exogenous heat, and the onset of cardiovascular strain by an air temperature of {\~{}}3-4°C, irrespective of relative humidity (RH) for the young and elderly. Even above these critical limits, fans would apparently still provide marginal benefits at air temperatures as high as 51.1°C at 10{\%}RH for young adults and 48.1°C at 10{\%}RH for the elderly. Previous concerns that dehydration would be exacerbated with fan use do not seem likely, except under very hot ({\textgreater}40°C) and dry ({\textless}10{\%}RH) conditions, when predicted sweat losses are only greater with fans by a minor amount ({\~{}}20-30mL/h). Relative to the peak outdoor environmental conditions reported during ten of the most severe heat waves in recent history, fan use would be advisable in all of these situations, even when reducing the predicted maximum sweat output for the elderly. The protective benefit of fans appears to be underestimated by current guidelines.},

abstract = {We assessed whether increasing airflow with an electric fan is similarly effective as decreasing air temperature with air cooling (AC) in preventing heat-related reductions in productivity, and elevations in body temperatures and discomfort in a warm/humid indoor environment. In 48 experimental trials, we compared the reduction in the human heat stress response of sixteen participants during 135 min of intermittent arm ergometry at a fixed heart rate of 110 beats min −1 , from a simulated tropical environment (HOT; 30 °C, 70{\%}RH; wind {\textless} 0.2 m s −1 ) to that observed with either a, (i) 7 °C reduction in air temperature (AC; 23 °C, 70{\%}RH, wind {\textless} 0.2 m s −1 ); or (ii) facilitated airflow (FAN; 30 °C, 70{\%}RH, wind = 4.2 m s −1 ). Cumulative work was similarly improved (+11{\%}) by FAN compared to AC. Likewise, reductions in rectal temperature, thermal sensation, and thermal discomfort were similar with the two different cooling strategies. Sweat losses in the FAN trial were higher compared to AC but lower than HOT without fanning. In conclusion, fanning offers an effective method for alleviating thermal stress and preventing productivity losses for workers exposed to environmental heat. Moving air instead of chilling it may require a little more sweating, but it can save electricity and hence lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to AC.},

abstract = {Here we present a field study examining the impact of elevated room temperature and air movement on thermal comfort and self-reported productivity. This experiment was performed in three environmental conditions (one with a set-point of 23 °C—a typical set-point used in Singapore—and two elevated (up to 28 °C) room temperature conditions). Occupants had shared control of ceiling fans. The results show that the most comfortable thermal condition, with thermal sensation closest to neutral, is achieved at a room temperature of 26 °C with operating fans. Increasing the temperature set-point from 23 °C to 26 °C resulted in a significant increase in thermal acceptability (from 59{\%} to 91{\%}), and a 44 kWh/m2yr savings in electrical energy used for comfort cooling. We found that a room's set-point temperature can be increased up to 27 °C without creating a negative impact when controllable air movement is provided compared to an environment with a set-point of 23 °C. Thermal satisfaction is significantly higher in spaces of 26 °C with operating fans, than when the room's temperature is set at the typical 23 °C. Moreover, the relative humidity in the office is decreased from 62{\%} (when the temperature was 23 °C) to 50{\%} when the temperature was 27 °C. Occupant's self-reported ability to concentrate, be alert, and ability to be productive was comparably high in all conditions. The results indicate that work performance is poorly correlated with room temperature, but increases with greater individual thermal satisfaction.},

Methods While resting at a temperature of 42°C, relative humidity increased from 30{\%} to 70{\%} in 2{\%} increments every 5 min. On randomized days, the protocol was repeated without or with fan use. HR, core (Tcore) and mean skin (Tsk) temperatures were measured continuously. Whole-body sweat loss was measured from changes in nude body weight. Other measures of cardiovascular (cardiac output), thermoregulatory (local cutaneous and forearm vascular conductance, local sweat rate), and perceptual (thermal and thirst sensations) responses were also examined. Results When averaged over the entire protocol, fan use resulted in a small reduction of HR (-2 bpm, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -8 to 3), and slightly greater Tcore (+0.05°C; 95{\%} CI, -0.13 to 0.23) and Tsk (+0.03°C; 95{\%} CI, -0.36 to 0.42) in young adults. In contrast, fan use resulted in greater HR (+5 bpm; 95{\%} CI, 0-10), Tcore (+0.20°C; 95{\%} CI, 0.00-0.41), and Tsk (+0.47°C; 95{\%} CI, 0.18-0.76) in aged adults. A greater whole-body sweat loss during fan use was observed in young (+0.2 kg; 95{\%} CI, -0.2 to 0.6) but not aged (0.0 kg; 95{\%} CI, -0.2 to 0.2) adults. Greater local sweat rate and cutaneous vascular conductance were observed with fan use in aged adults. Other measures of cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, and perceptual responses were unaffected by fan use in both groups.

Fifty-four cases covering six cities (Helsinki, Berlin, Bordeaux, Rome, Jerusalem and Athens), three indoor environment categories I, II and III (according to standard EN 15251 2007) and three air velocities ({\textless}0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 m/s) were simulated. The required cooling/heating energy was calculated assuming a perfectly efficient HVAC system. A cooling energy saving between 17 and 48{\%} and a reduction of the maximum cooling power in the range 10-28{\%} has been obtained. The results reveal that the required power input of the fan is a critical factor for achieving energy saving at elevated room temperature. Under the assumptions of this study, the energy saving may not be achieved with the methods for air speed increase, such as ceiling, standing, tower and desk fans widely used today when the power consumption of the fan is higher than 20 W. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The thermostat setpoint range (deadband) in office buildings impacts both occupant thermal comfort and energy consumption. Zones operating within the deadband require no heating or cooling, and the terminal unit airflow volume rate may be reduced to its design minimum. Wider deadbands allow energy savings as well as lower total airflows through the terminal. The extent of such savings has not been systematically quantified. Reference models representing standard HVAC and building design practice were used to simulate the impact of thermostat setpoint ranges on annual HVAC energy consumption. Heating and cooling setpoints were varied parametrically in seven ASHRAE climate zones and in six distinct medium-sized office buildings, each representing either a new building design or a building controls retrofit. The minimum airflow volume rates through the VAV terminal units were also varied to represent both standard and best practices. The simulations are compared to empirical data from monitored buildings. Without reducing satisfaction levels, by increasing the cooling setpoint of 22.2°C (72°F) to 25°C (77°F), an average of 29{\%} of cooling energy and 27{\%} total HVAC energy savings are achieved. Reducing the heating setpoint of 21.1°C (70°F) to 20°C (68°F) saves an average of 34{\%} of terminal heating energy. Further widened temperature bands achieved with fans or personal controls can result in HVAC savings in the range of 32{\%}-73{\%} depending on the climate. It is demonstrated that in order to fully realize energy savings from widening thermostat temperature setpoints, today's typical VAV minimum volume flow rates should be reduced.},

abstract = {In warm environments, isothermal cooling by deliberately enhanced air movement can maintain thermal comfort using less energy than compressor-based air conditioning. To evaluate the performance of a brushless direct current (DC) stand fan, the cooling fan efficiency (CFE) index was measured in a climatic chamber under four dry-bulb temperatures (24, 26, 28, and 30°C), six speed settings (corresponding to centreline speeds in the range 0.6-2.5m/s at 1m distance), two fan-manikin distances (1 and 2m) and two orientations (front, side). The CFE index is defined as the ratio of the whole-body cooling effect generated by non-uniform airflow from the fan to its power consumption (°C/W). The CFE index overcomes the limitations of assessing the cooling effect based just on a few air speed measurements. The results show that the CFE index is influenced by dry-bulb temperature, fan speed setting, and fan-manikin distance, but not by fan-manikin orientation. The lower the temperature and the closer the fan, the higher is the CFE index. Increasing fan speed setting simultaneously enhances whole-body cooling and increases power use. Consequently, the CFE has a non-monotonic relationship with fan speed setting and the peak value is reached for an intermediate speed. As compared with previous testing results using an alternating current stand fan, the CFE index of the DC fan we tested is three times higher. As a complement to air-conditioning, the tested stand fan is a suitable energy-efficient technology for providing thermal comfort in warm environments.},

abstract = {In ASHRAE Standard 55-2010, the comfort effects of elevated air movement are evaluated using the SET index as computed by the Gagge 2-Node model of whole-body heat balance. Air movement in reality has many forms, which might create heat flows and thermal sensations that cannot be accurately predicted by a simple whole-body model. This paper addresses two of such potential inaccuracies: 1) indoor airflows may affect only a portion of the body surface (e.g., above desktop), and the affected body surface might be variably nude (e.g., face) or clothed, 2) the turbulence intensity (TI) in some typical airstreams (e.g., those created by fans) might have a different impact on heat transfer than the TI implicit in 2-Node's single convective heat transfer coefficient. For both these issues, can a whole-body index like SET represent such a wide range of possible exposures to airflow?Measurements of thermal sensation were obtained from human subjects using face-level fans in warm environments. Previous laboratory studies of a range of airstream sources were also analyzed. The effects of turbulence intensity were examined with manikin tests.The results show that indices derived from the 2-Node model of whole-body heat balance are effective at predicting thermal sensation under most non-uniform air movement. In contrast, the PMV index underestimates cooling in warm conditions. Turbulence increases the cooling effect of air movement, but by amounts that might be neglected for most design purposes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We measured indoor air speeds generated by ceiling fans in 78 full-scale laboratory tests. The factors were the room size, fan diameter, type, speed, direction (up or down), blade height, and mount distance (i.e. blade to ceiling height). We demonstrated the influence of these factors, showing that the most significant are speed, diameter and direction. With other factors fixed, the average room air speed in the occupied zone increases proportionally with fan air speed and diameter. Blowing fans upwards yields lower but far more uniform air speeds than downwards. We show that for the same fan diameter and airflow, fan type has little effect on the air speed distribution in the region outside the fan blades. We developed several new dimensionless representations and demonstrate that they are appropriate for comparisons over a wide range of fan and room characteristics. Dimensionless linear models predict the lowest, average, and highest air speeds in a room with a median (and 90 th percentile) absolute error of 0.03 (0.08), 0.05 (0.13), and 0.12 (0.26) m/s respectively over all 56 downwards tests, representing common applications. These models allow designers to quickly and easily estimate the air speeds they can expect for a given fan and room. We include all measured data and analysis code in this paper.},

@article{Davis2015,
abstract = {As household incomes rise around the world and global temperatures go up, the use of air conditioning is poised to increase dramatically. Air conditioning growth is expected to be particularly strong in middle-income countries, but direct empirical evidence is scarce. In this paper we use high-quality microdata from Mexico to describe the relationship between temperature, income, and air conditioning. We describe both how electricity consumption increases with temperature given current levels of air conditioning, and how climate and income drive air conditioning adoption decisions. We then combine these estimates with predicted end-of-century temperature changes to forecast future energy consumption. Under conservative assumptions about household income, our model predicts near-universal saturation of air conditioning in all warm areas within just a few decades. Temperature increases contribute to this surge in adoption, but income growth by itself explains most of the increase. What this will mean for electricity consumption and carbon dioxide emissions depends on the pace of technological change. Continued advances in energy efficiency or the development of new cooling technologies could reduce the energy consumption impacts. Similarly, growth in low-carbon electricity generation could mitigate the increases in carbon dioxide emissions. However, the paper illustrates the enormous potential impacts in this sector, highlighting the importance of future research on adaptation and underscoring the urgent need for global action on climate change.},

@article{Redlarski2016,
abstract = {Body surface area (BSA) plays a key role in several medical fields, including cancer chemotherapy, transplantology, burn treatment and toxicology. BSA is often a major factor in the determination of the course of treatment and drug dosage. A series of formulae to simplify the process have been developed. Because easy-To-identify, yet general, body coefficient results of those formulae vary considerably, the question arises as to whether the choice of a particular formula is valid and safe for patients. Here we show that discrepancies between most of the known BSA formulae can reach 0.5 m 2 for the standard adult physique. Although many previous studies have demonstrated that certain BSA formulae provide an almost exact fit with the patients examined, all of these studies have been performed on a limited and isolated group of people. Our analysis presents a broader perspective, considering 25 BSA formulae. The analysis revealed that the choice of a particular formula is a difficult task. Differences among calculations made by the formulae are so great that, in certain cases, they may considerably affect patients' mortality, especially for people with an abnormal physique or for children.},

@book{VanSomeren2011,
abstract = {This chapter focuses on age-related changes in temperature sensitivity and thermoregulation in humans. Core temperature is the net result of heat production and heat loss. Deviations from the optimal temperature occur for two main reasons: physical activity generates heat and environmental heat or cold affects body temperature as well. These changes need to be sensed, processed, and counteracted if necessary. Thus, the thermoregulatory system can be conceptualized as containing three parts: thermosensitive afferent pathways, neuronal integration and control systems, and descending effector pathways altering heat gain or loss. The functional anatomy and physiological mechanisms of these compartments and their alterations with aging are covered in separate sections: thermoreception; thermogenesis, heat gain, and heat retention; heat loss and reduction of heat gain; and central thermoregulatory control including circadian rhythms. Further, humans need to regulate their body temperature to survive. Most of the deaths due to hypothermia or hyperthermia occur in elderly subjects. The reason the elderly especially are at such an increased risk of thermoregulatory deficit is not a new question, yet still important and not solved. Is it because their capability to sense temperature is compromised, because their thermoregulatory capacities are limited, or because their physiology is less tolerant to extreme temperatures? This discussion also describes what is known about the changes in thermoreception and thermoregulation with increasing age. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Tartarini2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} SAGE Publications. This study aimed to determine the specific correlation between indoor air temperature and agitation of nursing home residents with dementia. Agitated behaviors of 21 residents, living in 1 nursing home, were assessed for a 10-month period using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). The CMAI Total Frequency scores were found to increase significantly when indoor average temperatures deviated from 22.6°C. In addition, cumulative exposure to temperatures higher than 26°C and lower than 20°C was linearly correlated with CMAI Total Frequency scores. Results showed that agitated behaviors not only affected the person manifesting them but were found to be disruptive for other residents and the delivery of care. Agitation can, therefore, be potentially reduced by limiting the range of indoor air temperature variations, and aged care providers should ensure that a thermally comfortable environment is provided in nursing homes to enhance comfort and well-being of all occupants.},
