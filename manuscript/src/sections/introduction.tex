\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Anthropogenic activities are the primary causes of global warming.
From the pre-industrial period human activities are estimated to be the primary cause of a 1~$^{\circ}$C increase in the Earth's global average temperature~\cite{GlobalWa91:online}.
Since 1981 the combined land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of 0.18~$^{\circ}$C per decade~\cite{GlobalCl28:online}.
As a consequence, nine of the ten warmest years on records have occurred since 2005~\cite{ClimateC26:online}.
It is estimated that by 2030 the rate at which temperature increases is going to accelerate due to the heating imbalance between the greenhouse gases and the oceans' thermal inertia~\cite{ClimateC26:online}.
Consequently, associated risk to rising temperatures such as heatwaves are expected to increase in length, intensity and frequency due to global warming~\cite{Whatharm75:online}.
There is not an universally definition of heatwave, however, the \ac{wmo} and \ac{who} describe them as: ``a periods of unusually hot and dry or hot and humid weather that have a subtle onset and cessation, a duration of at least two or three days, usually with a discernible impact on human and natural systems"~\cite{WMO2015}.
Thermoregulatory factors, demographics and socioeconomic characteristics such as age (very young and elderly), pre-existing conditions, low income, prolonged outdoor activities, and social isolation all play a negative role and increase the heat risk of an individual during heat waves~\cite{WMO2015}.
Heatwaves may also put an additional burden on the health, emergency, energy, water and transportation sectors.
For example, during heat waves peak demand consumption increases due to an increase energy demand for cooling, while the efficiency of the grid and the power plant decrease.
This may result in power shortages and blackouts.

Both humid and dry heat conditions can affect the heat balance of the human body.
Rapid changes in heat gains can compromise the ability of the body to regulate its core temperature and can worsen health of those with pre-existing conditions or result in illnesses which may even be life threatening~\cite{WMO2015}.
The \ac{who}, and the \ac{wmo} together with national governments provide public health guidance for people to minimise the heat stress during heatwaves.
For example, they suggest to keep the body hydrated, to keep out of the heat and keep the home cool.
However, despite the quantitative evidence provided by \mycite{Jay2015} and \mycite{Jay2019a}, the \ac{who} does not recommend the use of electric fan when temperatures exceed 35~$^{\circ}$C~\cite{HeatandH28:online, WMO2015}.
% todo add more examples of standards that discourage the se of fans at high temperatures
This suggestion, however, could be detrimental for many people around the world since many of them may neither have the resources to cool their space using air conditioning, nor the ability to travel to public spaces which are cooler.
Some of these people could be in fact the elderly, people with mobility issues or poor people living either in remote areas or in developing parts of the world.
% todo say something about the fact that many poor people even have limited access to electricity
These groups are already more at risk than the rest of the population, and by discouraging them from utilizing electrical fans when temperatures exceed 35~$^{\circ}$C can exacerbate heat stress.
\mycite{Jay2015} demonstrated that the use of fans is beneficial even if \ac{t-db} is higher than \ac{t-sk}, as long as the increase in \ac{e-sk} can compensate for the extra sensible heat gains~\cite{Jay2015}.

Electrical fans are relative inexpensive to buy (can be purchased for 20 USD), energy efficient, do not have any installation cost and can consume as low as few Watts of power to operate~\cite{Jay2019a, Yang2015a, Lipczynska2018a}.
Electrical fans can therefore be used as an alternative cooling technology or in combination with compressor-based air conditioning~\cite{Jay2019a, Yang2015a, Lipczynska2018a}.
The use of electrical fans has the potential of reducing the peak energy demand during heatwaves and the burden on the electrical grid.
Previous research has also shown that can they be used in tropical hot and humid climates to increase occupants satisfaction with their thermal environment~\cite{Lipczynska2018a}.

To better understand under which environmental conditions (i.e., \ac{t-db}, \ac{rh}) the use of fans would be beneficial, \mycite{Jay2015} developed a simplified heat balance model.
However, their model had the following limitations, it does not: consider radial asymmetry, estimates iteratively \ac{t-sk} and \ac{t-cr}, allow user to change the value of \ac{met} or \ac{clo}.
Moreover, their results are based on a single air speed velocity 4.5~m/s which cannot be achieved by most of ceiling fans~\cite{Raftery2019}, and pedestal fans~\cite{Yang2015a}.
The value of 4.5~m/s was measured at one meter away from the fan, hence, their results are difficult to generalise.
Consequently, to overcome the above mentioned limitations, we are proposing the use of the heat balance model developed by~\mycite{GaggeSET} to estimate heat loss and physiological variables as a function of environmental and personal factors.
\mycite{GaggeSET} model is currently being used to calculate the \ac{set}, it, however, can be used to estimate the combinations of \ac{t-db}, \ac{rh}, \ac{t-r}, \ac{v}, \ac{clo}, \ac{met} at which the use of elevated air speed would be beneficial during heatwaves.
In addition, to help the overall community we developed an open-source, free to use, web-based online tool which provides interactive plots and displays the results to the user.
Our tool allows users to determine when people can safely use elevated air speeds to cool their body.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item I do not really see the benefit of the model proposed by Hosper since: 1) they set the limit of sweating to 440 mL/h; and they limit 2) the amount of water than I person can spray on him self to 116 mL/h. This would not affect the results in the SET model since with the SET model the estimated sweating rate is lower.
%    Very dry climates could benefit from using evaporative cooling.
