\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

In this manuscript, we used the heat balance model that \mycite{GaggeSET} developed to derive the \ac{set}.
This model allowed us to estimate how environmental (i.e., \ac{t-db}, \ac{t-r}, \ac{v}, \ac{rh}) and personal factors (\ac{clo}, \ac{met}) influence both the latent and sensible components of the \ac{q-sk}, and \ac{q-res}.
Moreover, it allowed to derive physiological variables such as, \ac{t-sk}, and \ac{t-cr}.

The following Sections describe the main Equations used to calculate the results.
We have open sourced the algorithm we used to calculate the results and published to code on a public repository.
% todo say that Gagge's equation is written in a un-used language, hence we have converted it to Python and JavaScript
Moreover, we added it to the pythermalcomfort Python package~\cite{Tartarini2020a} and the CBE thermal comfort tool~\cite{Tartarini2020}.
The former can be used by Python users to calculate the results presented in this manuscript.
The latter is a web-based tool that can be used to generate interactive figures which show the set of environmental conditions under which the use of elevated air speeds is beneficial.

\subsection{Energy Balance}\label{subsec:energy-balance}

The human body exchanges both sensible and latent heat with its surrounding environment.
Sensible heat flow comprises a combination of conduction, convection and radiation (\acs{c-r} + \acs{c-res}).
While latent heat losses occur from evaporation of sweat  (\acs{e-rsw}), moisture diffused through the skin  (\acs{e-dif}), and moisture during respiration (\acs{e-res})
The energy balance in the human body is summarized in Eq.~\ref{eq:heat-balance}.

\begin{equation}
    M - W = (C + R + E_{sk}) + (C_{res} + E_{res}) + (S_{sk} + S_{cr})\label{eq:heat-balance}
\end{equation}

This equation assumes that the body comprises two thermal compartments: the skin and the core.
In steady state condition (i.e., the \ac{t-sk}, and \ac{t-cr} remain constant) the \ac{s-cr}, and the \ac{s-sk} are equal to zero.

The amount of sensible heat gains or losses from the human body to its environment can be expressed as a function of environmental, and personal factors.
The former are \ac{t-db}, \ac{t-db}, \ac{v}, and \ac{rh}.
While the independent personal factors are \ac{met}, and \ac{clo}~\cite{ASHRA2017}.

\subsubsection{Thermal Exchanges with Environment}\label{subsubsec:thermal-exchanges-with-environment}

This section summarizes the main equations used by the energy balance model to calculate the various terms presented in Eq.~\ref{eq:heat-balance}.
The equations to estimate sensible and latent heat loss are based on fundamental heat transfer theory, while the coefficient used were estimated empirically~\cite{ASHRA2017}.

\paragraph{Body Surface Area}

All the terms presented in Eq.~\ref{eq:heat-balance} are reported in power per unit of human \ac{body-a}.
\mycite{DuBois} Equation~\ref{eq:dubois} can be used to estimate \ac{body-a} as a function of the \ac{body-w} and \ac{body-h} of the person.

\begin{equation}
    A_{body} = 0.202 m^{0.425} l^{0.725}\label{eq:dubois}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Sensible Heat Loss from Skin}

Sensible heat losses from the human body mainly occur from convection and radiation from the skin to the environment.
The total amount of \ac{c-r} can be described as a function of the \ac{t-sk}, \ac{t-op}, \ac{r-cl}, \ac{f-cl}, and \ac{h}.
The equation can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    C+R=\frac{t_{s k}-t_{o}}{R_{c l}+1 /\left(f_{c l} h\right)}\label{eq:c-r}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f_{cl}=1.0 + 0.31 I_{cl} \label{eq:f-cl}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    h=h_{c} + h_{r} = \max(3, 8.6 v^{0.53}) p_{atm}^{0.53} + 4 \varepsilon \sigma \frac{A_{\mathrm{r}}}{A_{body}}\left[273.2+\frac{\left(t_{\mathrm{cl}}+\overline{t_{r}}\right)}{2}\right]^{3}\label{eq:h}
\end{equation}

% todo say that skin temperature is calc iteratively
% todo describe variables that did not appear in the text before

Where \ac{t-op} varies as a function of \ac{h-c}, \ac{h-r}, \ac{t-r} and \ac{t-db}, and it is described by:

\begin{equation}
    t_{o}=\frac{h_{r} \bar{t}_{r}+h_{c} t_{db}}{h_{r}+h_{c}}\label{eq:t-op}
\end{equation}

The \ac{t-sk} is calculated iteratively since it varies as a function of the heat loss from the human body towards its environment and the heat transferred from the core to the skin node.
While \ac{t-cl} can be caclualted as a function of the \ac{t-op}, \ac{t-sk}, \ac{r-cl} and the resistance of the air layer.

\paragraph{Latent Heat Loss from Skin}

The \ac{e-sk} comprises two terms the \ac{e-rsw} and the \ac{e-dif}.
The \ac{e-sk} depends on the \ac{w}, \ac{p-sk} normally assumed to be that of saturated water vapor at \ac{t-sk}, \ac{p-a}, \ac{f-cl}, \ac{h-e}, and \ac{r-e-cl}:

\begin{equation}
    E_{s k}=E_{rsw}+E_{dif}=\frac{w\left(p_{s k, s}-p_{a}\right)}{R_{e, c l}+1 /\left(f_{c l} h_{e}\right)}\label{eq:latent-skin}
\end{equation}

Where the \ac{w} can vary from 0 and 1.

% todo describe variables that did not appear in the text before

Despite the fact that Eq.~\ref{eq:latent-skin} is expressed as a function of \ac{w}.
The human body does not regulates the \acl{w} but, rather, it regulates the sweat rate~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
Skin wettedness varies as a function of the activity of the sweat glands and the environmental conditions~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
While theoretically skin wettedness can range from 0 to 1.
In practice, \ac{w} is strongly correlated with thermal stress and warm discomfort, consequently there is a practical upper limit for sustained activity for healthy and acclimatized humans~\cite{ASHRA2017}.

We estimated the \ac{w-max} value and the \ac{m-sweat} using the \mycite{GaggeSET} model.

% todo write equation to estimate sweat losses

\paragraph{Respiratory Losses}
The human body exchanges both sensible and latent heat with its environment.
The \ac{q-res} equals the sum of \ac{c-res} and the \ac{e-res}.
The value of \ac{q-res} is can be determined using the following simplified equation~\cite{ASHRA2017}:

\begin{equation}
    q_{res} = C_{res} + E_{res} = 0.0014M(34-t_{a}) + 0.0173M(5.87-p_{a})\label{eq:respiratory-losses}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{subsec:data-analysis}

The above mentioned equations were used to calculate \ac{c-r}, \ac{e-sk}, \ac{m-sweat}, \ac{t-cr}.
We calculated the above mentioned variables for \ac{t-db} ranging from 25 and 50~Â°C, \ac{rh} ranging from 0 to 100 \% and \ac{v} from 0.1 and 4.5~m/s.
Were \ac{v}~=~0.1 m/s is considered to be the `still air condition' in accordance with the ASHRAE 55--2017 Standard~\cite{ashrae552017}.
We assumed \ac{t-r} to be equal to \ac{t-db}, \ac{clo}~=~0.5 clo, and \ac{met} = 1.0 met, unless otherwise specified.
We multiplied all the values that are expressed per unit of surface area (i.e., \ac{e-sk}) by \ac{body-a} to obtain the total heat exchanged by the human body.
The limit above which thermal stress would occur was assumed to be when the value of \ac{w} was equal to the value of \ac{w-max}.
We assumed that the use of electrical fans is detrimental when the \ac{t-cr} estimated using elevated air speed was higher than the `still air' condition.
