\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

We used the heat balance model that Gagge et al. (\citeyear{GaggeSET}) developed to derive the \ac{set} to estimate the \ac{e_req}, \ac{e_max}, and \ac{sweat} as a function of the following input variables: \ac{tdb}, \ac{tr}, \ac{rh}, \ac{v}, \ac{clo}, and \ac{met}.

\subsection{Heat balance model model}\label{subsec:heat-balance-model-model}

The human body needs to dissipate the heat generated by the \ac{met} minus the accomplished \ac{work} in order to maintain heat balance.
It achieves this by dissipating heat via either convection, evaporation, conduction or respiration, as summarized in Eq.~\ref{eq:heat-balance}.

\begin{equation}
    E_{req} = M - W - (C + R) - (C_{res} + E_{res}) - C_{cond}\label{eq:heat-balance}
\end{equation}
