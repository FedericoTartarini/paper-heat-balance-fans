\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

The energy balance model we used estimates how environmental (\ac{t-db}, \ac{t-r}, \ac{v}, \ac{rh}) and personal factors (\ac{clo}, \ac{met}) influence both latent and sensible components of the \ac{q-sk}, and the \ac{q-res}.
Moreover, it can be used to estimate the value of some physiological variables such as \ac{t-sk}, and \ac{t-cr}.
In non-uniform environments \ac{t-db} and \ac{v} are assumed to be equal to the average temperature and air speed measured at 0.1, 0.6, and 1.1~m height for seated occupants and at 0.1, 1.1, and 1.7~m for standing occupants.

Section~\ref{subsec:energy-balance} describes the main Equations used by the model to derive the results.

\subsection{Energy Balance}\label{subsec:energy-balance}

The human body exchanges both sensible and latent heat with its surrounding environment.
Heat gain or loss from the human body to its environment can be expressed as a function of environmental and personal factors~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
Sensible heat is transferred via conduction, convection and radiation (\acs{c-r} + \acs{c-res}).
Latent heat loss occurs from the evaporation of sweat (\acs{e-rsw}), moisture diffused through the skin  (\acs{e-dif}), and respiration (\acs{e-res}).
The energy balance in the human body is described by:

\begin{equation}
    M - W = C + R + E_{sk} + C_{res} + E_{res} + S_{sk} + S_{cr}\label{eq:heat-balance}
\end{equation}

This equation assumes that the body comprises two main thermal compartments: the skin and the core.
If the exogenous and endogenous heat gains cannot be compensated by heat loss, then both the \ac{s-sk}, and the \ac{s-cr} increase and in turn the \ac{t-sk}, and \ac{t-cr} rise, respectively.
One of the main differences between \mycite{GaggeSET} model and the one used by \mycite{Jay2015} is that \mycite{Jay2015} does not account for heat stored in the core or the skin compartment;
hence, they assume the values of \ac{t-sk} and \ac{t-cr} to be constant.
Calculating how \ac{t-sk} and \ac{t-cr} vary as a function of different environmental and personal factors allows us to better predict how much heat the body exchanges with its surrounding environment~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
It should be noted that the steady-state model proposed by \mycite{Jay2015} is more conservative since it assumes a constant value for \ac{t-sk}, overestimating the sensible heat gains when \ac{t-db} exceeds \ac{t-sk}.
The equations used to determine sensible and latent heat loss are based on fundamental heat transfer theory, while the coefficients were estimated empirically~\cite{ASHRA2017}.

\subsubsection{Body Surface Area}

All the terms presented in Equation~\ref{eq:heat-balance} are reported in power per unit of human \ac{body-a}.
Equation~\ref{eq:dubois} can be used to estimate \ac{body-a} as a function of the \ac{body-w} and \ac{body-h}~\cite{DuBois}.

\begin{equation}
    A_{body} = 0.202 mass^{0.425} height^{0.725}\label{eq:dubois}
\end{equation}

In thermal comfort research, this value is generally assumed to be constant and equal to 1.8~m$^{2}$.
Several other equations have been developed to estimate \ac{body-a} and we allow users to specify \ac{body-a} as the input value.
Alternative equations to the DuBois equation are available.
A recent detailed review paper concluded that most of the proposed equations in the literature were in agreement with each other to estimate \ac{body-a} for adults with a healthy weight and standard physique~\cite{Redlarski2016}.

\subsubsection{Sensible Heat Loss from Skin}

Sensible heat loss from the human body mainly occurs from convection and radiation from the skin to the environment.
The total amount of \ac{c-r} can be described as a function of \ac{t-sk}, \ac{t-op}, \ac{r-cl}, \ac{f-cl}, and \ac{h}.
The equation can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    C+R=\frac{t_{s k}-t_{o}}{R_{c l}+1 /\left(f_{c l} h\right)}\label{eq:c-r}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f_{cl}=1.0 + 0.31 I_{cl} \label{eq:f-cl}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    h=h_{c} + h_{r} = \max(3.0, 8.6 V^{0.53}) p_{atm}^{0.53} + 4 \varepsilon \sigma \frac{A_{\mathrm{r}}}{A_{body}}\left[273.2+\frac{\left(t_{\mathrm{cl}}+\overline{t_{r}}\right)}{2}\right]^{3}\label{eq:h}
\end{equation}

Where the ratio between \ac{a-r} and \ac{body-a} is assumed to be 0.70 for a sitting person and 0.73 for a standing person~\cite{Fanger1967}.
The \ac{e} is close to unity (typically 0.95) and the \ac{sigma} is a constant.
The value of \ac{t-op} varies as a function of the \ac{h-c}, \ac{h-r}, \ac{t-r} and \ac{t-db}, and it is described by:

\begin{equation}
    t_{o}=\frac{h_{r} \bar{t}_{r}+h_{c} t_{db}}{h_{r}+h_{c}}\label{eq:t-op}
\end{equation}

In \mycite{GaggeSET} model, the value of \ac{t-sk} is calculated iteratively since it varies as a function of the heat loss from the human body towards its environment and the heat transferred from the core to the skin node, as shown in Source Code~\ref{lst:pythonCode}.
\Ac{t-cl} can be calculated as a function of \ac{t-op}, \ac{t-sk}, \ac{r-cl} and the resistance of the air layer.
As previously stated, it should be noted that this is not a conservative approach and in some circumstances it may underestimate the value of \ac{c-r}.

\subsubsection{Latent Heat Loss from Skin, (\acs{e-sk})}

The \acf{e-sk} comprises two terms: the \ac{e-rsw} and the \ac{e-dif}.
\ac{e-sk} depends on the \ac{w}, \ac{p-sk} normally assumed to be that of saturated water vapor at \ac{t-sk}, \ac{p-a}, \ac{f-cl}, \ac{h-e}, and \ac{r-e-cl}.

\begin{equation}
    E_{s k}=E_{rsw}+E_{dif}=\frac{w\left(p_{s k, s}-p_{a}\right)}{R_{e, c l}+1 /\left(f_{c l} h_{e}\right)}\label{eq:latent-skin}
\end{equation}

Although Equation~\ref{eq:latent-skin} is expressed as a function of \ac{w}, the human body does not regulate \ac{w} directly but, rather, it regulates the \ac{m-sweat}.
The value of \ac{m-sweat} can be predicted by the deviation of \ac{t-sk} and \ac{t-cr} from their set neutral value, and it is described by:

\begin{equation}
    m_{rsw}=c_{sw}((1 - \alpha) (t_{cr} - t_{cr,n}) + \alpha (t_{sk} - t_{sk,n})) \exp (\frac{t_{sk}-t_{sk,n}}{10.7})\label{eq:regulatory-sweating}
\end{equation}

Where the \ac{c-sw} is assumed to be equal to 170~g/(hKm\textsuperscript{2}), the \ac{t-cr-n} is equal to 36.8~$^{\circ}$C and \ac{t-sk-n} is equal to 33.7~$^{\circ}$C\@.
The values of \ac{t-sk} and \ac{t-cr} are calculated iteratively by solving the heat balance equation.
The \ac{a} is determined using:

\begin{equation}
    \alpha_{sk}=0.0418+\frac{0.745}{m_{b l}-0.585}\label{eq:alpha}
\end{equation}

Where the \ac{m-bl} is limited to a maximum of 90~L/(hm\textsuperscript{2}).

Skin wettedness varies as a function of the activity of the sweat glands and the environmental conditions.
It correlates with warm discomfort and is a good measure of thermal stress.
While \ac{w} can theoretically range from 0 to 1 and skin wettedness can approach 1.0 while the body still maintains thermoregulatory control~\cite{ASHRA2017}, in most situations, the upper limit of \ac{w} is lower than 1.
\mycite{GaggeSET} used the following equations to determine \ac{w-max} for healthy and acclimatized humans:

\begin{equation}
    w_{max}=
\begin{cases}
    0.38 V^{-0.29} & \text{if } I_{cl} = 0 \text{ (i.e., naked)} \\
    0.59 V^{-0.08} & \text{if } I_{cl} > 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

On the other hand, \mycite{Jay2015} adjusted the value of \ac{w-max} based on fan use and age.
For young adults, they assumed \ac{w-max} to be equal to 0.65 for the `fan on' condition and 0.85 for the `fan off' condition.
These values are higher than those estimated by the \mycite{GaggeSET} model.

\subsubsection{Respiratory Losses, ($q_{res}$)}
The human body exchanges both sensible and latent heat with its environment.
The \acf{q-res} equals the sum of the \ac{c-res} and the \ac{e-res}.
The value of \ac{q-res} is can be determined using the following simplified equation~\cite{ASHRA2017}:

\begin{equation}
    q_{res} = C_{res} + E_{res} = 0.0014M(34-t_{a}) + 0.0173M(5.87-p_{a})\label{eq:respiratory-losses}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{subsec:data-analysis}

The heat balance model was used to estimate sensible and latent heat loss and several physiological parameters (e.g., \ac{m-sweat}, \ac{t-cr}).
We calculated the results for three discrete values of \ac{v} = 0.2, 0.8 and 4.5~m/s.
In this paper, we will be referring to `still air' condition when air velocities are below \ac{v}~=~0.2 m/s.
This definition is in accordance with the ASHRAE 55--2017 Standard~\cite{ashrae552017} and allowed us to compare our results with those obtained by \mycite{Jay2015}.
We assumed \ac{t-r} to be equal to \ac{t-db}, \ac{clo}~=~0.5~clo, and \ac{met}~=~1.1~met, unless otherwise specified.
It could be argued that some people during heatwaves may be wearing much less clothing than that, hence, a value of \ac{clo} equal to 0.36~clo (i.e., walking shorts, short-sleeve shirt, underwear, socks, and shoes) or 0.37~clo (i.e., short-sleeve dress, underwear, bra, socks, and shoes) would be more appropriate, however, we wanted to use a more conservative value.
Results for different combinations of environmental and personal conditions can be generated using our online tool.
In this manuscript, we assumed the \ac{i-cl} to be constant and equal to 1 and 0.45, as assumed by \mycite{GaggeSET}, for naked and clothed people, respectively.
Users can, however, change this value in the source code.
We report heat losses per unit of skin surface area.
Thermal strain is assumed to occur when either of the following parameters reaches their maximum value: \ac{w}, skin blood flow, or \ac{m-sweat}.
The former assumption is based on the fact that there is a \ac{w-max} for healthy and acclimatized humans~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
The other two assumptions are based on the fact that \mycite{GaggeSET} state that serious danger of fatality exists when blood flow from the core to the skin is maximal or sweating reaches its maximum.
We assumed that the use of electric fans is detrimental when the value of \ac{t-cr} calculated for values of \ac{v} higher than 0.2~m/s exceeds the value determined for the `still air' condition.

Results were calculated using the  \verb|pythermalcomfort| Python package~\cite{Tartarini2020a}.
A copy of the algorithm we used to calculate the results can also be found in \ref{sec:python_code}.
Lines in Figures~\ref{fig:comparison_models}, \ref{fig:results_model_2}, \ref{fig:comparison_air_speed}, \ref{fig:met_clo}, \ref{fig:energy_storage_delta}, and \ref{fig:use_fans_and_population} were smoothed using the \verb|Scipy| function \verb|ndimage.gaussian_filter1d|.
We developed a tool that can be used to generate interactive figures that show the environmental conditions under which the use of elevated air speeds is beneficial.
This tool has been added and integrated into the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool~\cite{Tartarini2020}.

\subsection{Predicted Heat Strain Model}\label{subsec:predicted-heat-strain-model}

We also compared our results with those obtained from the \ac{phs} model.
The \ac{phs} model allows the analytical evaluation of the thermal stress experienced by a subject in a hot environment.
It allows to predict the \ac{m-sweat} and \ac{t-re} that the human body will develop in response to the working conditions~\cite{iso7933}.
The \ac{phs} model has been validated based on a database including 747 lab experiments and 366 field experiments, from 8 research institutions~\cite{iso7933}.
It has not been validated for metabolic rates lower than 1.7 met (100 W/m\textsuperscript{2}), \ac{t-db} higher than 50~$^{\circ}$C and water vapour partial pressure ($p_{a}$) higher than 4~kPa (i.e., humidity ratio of \var{hr_4_kpa}~kg$_{water}$/kg$_{dry air}$).
In this present study we are determining when fans should be used by individuals with a \ac{met}~=~1.1~met, hence, we used the \ac{phs} model outside its ranges of validity.
We calculated the \ac{phs} using the \verb|pythermalcomfort| Python package~\cite{Tartarini2020a} function \verb|phs|.
We assumed that elevated air speed is detrimental when the maximum allowable exposure time for heat storage estimated with a \ac{v}~=~0.8~m/s is higher than the value estimated with a \ac{v}~=~0.2~m/s.

\subsection{Weather Data}\label{subsec:weather-data}

To better understand in which locations worldwide the use of electric fans would be beneficial we compared the results obtained from the heat balance model with the climatic data provided in the 2017 ASHRAE Handbook--Fundamentals~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
We also used the records from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) which contains a list of the deadliest heatwaves recorded from 1936 to the present date~\cite{EMDATThe70:online}.

From the ASHRAE climatic design dataset, we extracted weather data from more than 5000 stations worldwide.
For each station we collected the maximum extreme \ac{t-db} with a 20 year return period
and the \ac{t-db} corresponding to the hottest 0.4~\% of annual cumulative frequency of occurrence and the mean coincident \ac{t-wb}.
For more information about the ASHRAE climate design dataset please refer to Chapter~14 of the 2017 ASHRAE Handbook--Fundamentals~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
The location of the stations and their respective maximum extreme dry-bulb temperatures are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:world-map}.
We do not show data from stations with a maximum temperature lower than 26~$^\circ$C\@ since we are only interested in assessing the benefit of using fans during hot days.

\begin{figure*}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/world-map}
    \caption{Shows the location of each weather station that was included in the analysis and the maximum extreme dry-bulb temperature with a 20 year return period.}
    \label{fig:world-map}
\end{figure*}

Few data are available for Sub-Saharan Africa where approximately 40~\% of the poorest people in the world reside and where climate change may be an acute threat~\cite{PovertyO1:online}.

To determine the coincident value of \ac{rh} when the maximum extreme \ac{t-db} with a 20 year return period was recorded we first determined the humidity ratio for each location using the \ac{t-db} corresponding to the hottest 0.4~\% of annual cumulative frequency of occurrence and the mean coincident \ac{t-wb}.
We then assumed that during a heatwave the humidity ratio would remain constant while only the value of \ac{t-db} would increase.
This assumption allowed us to estimate, for each location, the value of \ac{rh} for each extreme \ac{t-db}.
This is an approximation and it does not take into account that during heat waves the value of humidity ratio may also increase.
More information on this is presented in \ref{sec:validation_rh}.

We also assumed that during heatwaves \ac{t-db} and \ac{rh} indoors would be equal to \ac{t-db} and \ac{rh} outdoors.
Conditions indoors may be less severe than outdoors since the thermal mass of buildings may dump and shift peaks in outdoor temperature.
At the same time, the opposite scenario can also occur if there is a significant amount of internal load or solar gains indoors.
We are aware that this assumption has some limitations, however, we deemed it to be an acceptable approximation.
One possible solution was to simulate several building archetypes under different climatic conditions.
However, we would still have to make assumptions such as internal loads, geometry, and building materials.
This would ultimately have lead to uncertainties in the estimation of \ac{t-db}.
Moreover, we did not have access to the time series data for the past 20 years for those 5000 stations.

The EM-DAT contains detailed information on when the heatwave occurred, the location, the number of deaths, and the maximum temperature recorded.
However, it does not contain information about the \ac{rh} which is important for determining whether the use of electric fans would have been beneficial or not.

\subsection{City Population Data}\label{subsec:population-data}

We obtained the city population data from the demographic statistics database which is compiled and maintained by the \ac{un} statistics division~\cite{UNdatare88:online}.
The database was last updated in August 2020 and we used it to gather information about the number of people who live in the 115 most populous cities in the world.
When available we used the population of the urban agglomerate rather than of the city administrative boundary.
We then combined the population with the ASHRAE weather data to determine during extreme heat events: i) how many people were at high risk of experiencing \ac{t-db} higher than 35~$^{\circ}$C\@, and ii) how many people would benefit from the use of electric fans.
As mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:weather-data} weather data were not available for all the major cities in the world.
Consequently, we had to exclude the following cities from our analysis: Lagos in Nigeria, Dar es Salaam and Mwanza in Tanzania, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Faisalabad in Pakistan, Zibo and Zhongshan in China, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, and Bandung in Indonesia.
A full list of the cities we included in the analysis is provided in the \ref{sec:pop_weather}.
