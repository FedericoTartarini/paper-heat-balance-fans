\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}

% todo the set model has the issue with the fact that it iterates over that strange parameter lenght of time = 6o

In this manuscript, we used the heat balance model that \mycite{GaggeSET} developed to derive the \ac{set} to determine when the use of elevated air moment (e.g., \ac{v} $>$ 0.2 m/s) would be beneficial to cool the human body.
The heat balance model allows us to estimate how environmental (i.e., \ac{t-db}, \ac{t-r}, \ac{v}, \ac{rh}) and personal factors (i.e., \ac{clo}, \ac{met}) influence both latent and sensible components of the \ac{q-sk}, and the \ac{q-res}.
Moreover, it can be used to estimate the value of some physiological variables such as, \ac{t-sk}, and \ac{t-cr}.
It should be noted that \ac{t-db} and \ac{v} are the average values measured at different heights over a period of at least three minutes.
These heights are 0.1, 0.6 and 1.1 m for seated people and 0.1, 1.1 and 1.7 m for standing occupants~\cite{ashrae552017}.

Section~\ref{subsec:energy-balance} describe the main Equations used by the model to derive the results.
The algorithm we used to calculate the results can be found in the Appendix.

Moreover, we added it to the pythermalcomfort Python package~\cite{Tartarini2020a} and the CBE thermal comfort tool~\cite{Tartarini2020}.
The former can be used by Python users to calculate the results presented in this manuscript.
The latter is a web-based tool that can be used to generate interactive figures which show the environmental conditions under which the use of elevated air speeds is beneficial.

\subsection{Energy Balance}\label{subsec:energy-balance}

The human body exchanges both sensible and latent heat with its surrounding environment.
Sensible heat is transferred via conduction, convection and radiation (\acs{c-r} + \acs{c-res}).
While latent heat losses occur from evaporation of sweat  (\acs{e-rsw}), moisture diffused through the skin  (\acs{e-dif}), and respiration (\acs{e-res})
The energy balance in the human body is described by:

\begin{equation}
    M - W = (C + R + E_{sk}) + (C_{res} + E_{res}) + (S_{sk} + S_{cr})\label{eq:heat-balance}
\end{equation}

This equation assumes that the body comprises two main thermal compartments: the skin and the core.
If the exogenous and endogenous heat gains cannot be compensated by the heat losses, then both the \ac{s-sk}, and the \ac{s-cr} increase and in turn the \ac{t-sk}, and \ac{t-cr} rise, respectively.

The amount of sensible heat gains or losses from the human body to its environment can be expressed as a function of environmental, and personal factors.
The former are \ac{t-db}, \ac{t-r}, \ac{v}, and \ac{rh}.
While the latter are \ac{met}, and \ac{clo}~\cite{ASHRA2017}.

The equations used to determine sensible and latent heat loss are based on fundamental heat transfer theory, while the coefficient were estimated empirically~\cite{ASHRA2017}.

\subsubsection{Body Surface Area, (\acs{body-a})}

All the terms presented in Equation~\ref{eq:heat-balance} are reported in power per unit of human \ac{body-a}.
Equation~\ref{eq:dubois} can be used to estimate \ac{body-a} as a function of the \ac{body-w} and \ac{body-h} of the person~\cite{DuBois}.

\begin{equation}
    A_{body} = 0.202 m^{0.425} l^{0.725}\label{eq:dubois}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Sensible Heat Loss from Skin, (\acs{c-r})}

Sensible heat losses from the human body mainly occur from convection and radiation from the skin to the environment.
The total amount of \ac{c-r} can be described as a function of the \ac{t-sk}, \ac{t-op}, \ac{r-cl}, \ac{f-cl}, and \ac{h}.
The equation can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    C+R=\frac{t_{s k}-t_{o}}{R_{c l}+1 /\left(f_{c l} h\right)}\label{eq:c-r}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    f_{cl}=1.0 + 0.31 I_{cl} \label{eq:f-cl}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    h=h_{c} + h_{r} = \max(3, 8.6 v^{0.53}) p_{atm}^{0.53} + 4 \varepsilon \sigma \frac{A_{\mathrm{r}}}{A_{body}}\left[273.2+\frac{\left(t_{\mathrm{cl}}+\overline{t_{r}}\right)}{2}\right]^{3}\label{eq:h}
\end{equation}

% todo describe variables that did not appear in the text before

Where \ac{t-op} varies as a function of \ac{h-c}, \ac{h-r}, \ac{t-r} and \ac{t-db}, and it is described by:

\begin{equation}
    t_{o}=\frac{h_{r} \bar{t}_{r}+h_{c} t_{db}}{h_{r}+h_{c}}\label{eq:t-op}
\end{equation}

The \ac{t-sk} is calculated iteratively by the heat balance model since it varies as a function of the heat loss from the human body towards its environment and the heat transferred from the core to the skin node.
\Ac{t-cl} can be calculated as a function of the \ac{t-op}, \ac{t-sk}, \ac{r-cl} and the resistance of the air layer.

\subsubsection{Latent Heat Loss from Skin, (\acs{e-sk})}

The \acf{e-sk} comprises two terms the \ac{e-rsw} and the \ac{e-dif}.
\ac{e-sk} depends on the \ac{w}, \ac{p-sk} normally assumed to be that of saturated water vapor at \ac{t-sk}, \ac{p-a}, \ac{f-cl}, \ac{h-e}, and \ac{r-e-cl}.

\begin{equation}
    E_{s k}=E_{rsw}+E_{dif}=\frac{w\left(p_{s k, s}-p_{a}\right)}{R_{e, c l}+1 /\left(f_{c l} h_{e}\right)}\label{eq:latent-skin}
\end{equation}

Despite the fact that Equation~\ref{eq:latent-skin} is expressed as a function of \ac{w}.
The human body does not regulates \ac{w} directly but, rather, it regulates the sweat rate~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
Skin wettedness varies as a function of the activity of the sweat glands and the environmental conditions~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
While, theoretically \ac{w} can range from 0 to 1, in practice, \ac{w} is strongly correlated with thermal stress and warm discomfort, consequently there is a \ac{w-max} for sustained activity for healthy and acclimatized humans~\cite{ASHRA2017}.

We estimated the \ac{w-max} value and the \ac{m-sweat} using the \mycite{GaggeSET} model.

\subsubsection{Respiratory Losses, (\acs{q-res})}
The human body exchanges both sensible and latent heat with its environment.
The \acf{q-res} equals the sum of the \ac{c-res} and the \ac{e-res}.
The value of \ac{q-res} is can be determined using the following simplified equation~\cite{ASHRA2017}:

\begin{equation}
    q_{res} = C_{res} + E_{res} = 0.0014M(34-t_{a}) + 0.0173M(5.87-p_{a})\label{eq:respiratory-losses}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{subsec:data-analysis}

The heat balance model was used to estimate the sensible and latent heat loss and physiological parameters (e.g., \ac{m-sweat}, \ac{t-cr}).
We calculated the results for \ac{t-op} ranging from 28 to 55~$^{\circ}$C at 0.5~$^{\circ}$C intervals, \ac{rh} ranging from 0 to 100~\% at 5~\% intervals and for the discrete values of \ac{v} = 0.2, 0.8 and 4.5~m/s.
In this paper we will be referring to `still air' condition when air velocities are below \ac{v}~=~0.2 m/s.
This definition is in accordance with the ASHRAE 55--2017 Standard~\cite{ashrae552017} and allowed us to compare our results with those obtained by \mycite{Jay2015}.
We assumed \ac{t-r} to be equal to \ac{t-db}, \ac{clo}~=~0.5 clo, and \ac{met}~=~1.0 met, unless otherwise specified.
It could be argued that some people during heatwaves may be wearing less clothes than that, hence, a value of \ac{clo} equal to 0.36 clo (i.e., walking shorts, short-sleeve shirt and sandals) would be more appropriate, however, we wanted to use a more conservative value.
Moreover, results for different combinations of environmental and personal conditions can be generated using our online tool.
We reported heat loss per unit of surface area (i.e., \ac{e-sk}).
To obtain the absolute value of heat loss or gain the results can be multiplied by \ac{body-a}.
Thermal stress was assumed to occur when either of the following parameters reached its maximum value \ac{w}, skin blood flow or \ac{m-sweat}.
We assumed that the use of electrical fans is detrimental when the value of \ac{t-cr} calculated for values of \ac{v} higher than 0.2~m/s exceeds the value determined for the `still air' condition.

\subsection{Weather data}\label{subsec:weather-data}

The results obtained with the proposed heat balance model were compared with climatic data provided in the 2017 ASHRAE Handbook--Fundamentals~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
We used the ASHRAE climatic design dataset to extract information regarding the maximum extreme dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures recorded across more than 5000 stations worldwide with a 10 year return period.
For more information about the ASHRAE climate design dataset please refer to Chapter 14 of the 2017 ASHRAE Handbook--Fundamentals~\cite{ASHRA2017}.
Location of the stations and their respective maximum extreme dry-bulb temperatures are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:world-map}
We did not show data from stations with a maximum temperature lower than 20~$^\circ$C\@ since we are only interested in assessing the benefit of using fans during hot days.

\begin{figure}[thb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/world-map.png}
    \caption{Shows the location of each weather station that was included in the analysis and the maximum extreme dry-bulb temperature with a 10 year return period.}
    \label{fig:world-map}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:world-map} also shows that few data was available for the Sub-Saharan Africa where approximately 40~\% of the poorest people in the world reside and where climate change may be an acute threat~\cite{PovertyO1:online}.

For each location we assumed that the worst condition would occur if both the maximum extreme dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures would have been recorded at the same time.
This is an approximation and it is arguably overestimating the most extreme condition due to the fact that the likelihood that both conditions would occur at the same time is extremely low.
However, we assumed this to be the most extreme heat event that could occur in each location.
In addition, we assumed that during heatwaves \ac{t-db} and \ac{rh} indoors would be equal to \ac{t-db} and \ac{rh} outdoors.
Conditions indoors may, however, be slightly less severe than outdoors since the thermal mass of the building would dump and shift peaks in outdoor temperature.
On the other hand, if the house is not well shaded \ac{t-r} may rise significantly and worsen conditions indoors.
