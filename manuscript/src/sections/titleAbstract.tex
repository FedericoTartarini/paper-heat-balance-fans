\begin{abstract}
    The WHO classifies heatwaves as one of the most dangerous natural hazards causing more than 166'000 deaths from 1998--2017.
    Heatwaves mostly affect specific socioeconomic (e.g., poor) and demographics groups (e.g., elderly), those who work outdoors, and those with pre-existing conditions.
    Electric fans are an effective, efficient, and sustainable solution to cool people.
    They are for most applications the cheapest cooling technology available on the market.
    However, many national and international guidelines discourage people from using them when indoor air temperatures exceed the skin temperature (i.e., approximately 35~$^{\circ}$C\@).
    To verify the validity of those recommendations, we extended the applicability of an existing heat balance model to determine under which environmental (e.g., air temperature, air speed) and personal (i.e., metabolic rate, clothing) conditions the use of fans would be beneficial.
    We found that current guidelines are too restrictive.
    Electrical fans can be used safely in a wide range of conditions even if the indoor dry-bulb temperature exceeds the skin temperature.
    In addition, the use of elevated air speeds increases the critical operative temperature at which heat strain is expected to occur by an average of 2.0~$^{\circ}$C\@.
    The maximum operative temperature at which the use of elevated air speeds becomes detrimental is inversely proportional to the relative humidity.
    Consequently, to help researchers, building practitioners, policymakers and people worldwide to better understand under which conditions electrical fans can be safely used to cool people, we have developed a free, open-source, and easy-to-use online tool.
